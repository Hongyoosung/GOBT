# GOBT(Goal-Oriented Behavior Tree)
 ### A Synergistic Approach to Game AI Using Goal-Oriented and Utility-Based  Planning in Behavior Trees


  > Development of a game AI architecture framework that combines behavioral trees with GOAP and utility systems to achieve both high intuitiveness and flexibility.


<br/>

 ## Development Background
  >Behavior trees, widely used in game AI architecture, are effective for organizing and controlling the behavior of game characters due to their hierarchical structure. They are also easy to visually represent, making it easier for developers or other team members to understand and predict logic. While behavior trees have high intuitiveness, managing them can become complex when implementing intricate AI in large-scale games due to the potential rapid increase in tree depth and width. Additionally, they operate based on a static structure designed at the time of development, which may not adequately handle situations that developers did not anticipate.

  >This study aims to propose an AI framework named "GOBT (Goal-Oriented Behavior Tree)" to supplement existing behavior trees. This framework is a fusion of traditional behavior trees, Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) which is a goal-oriented behavioral planning framework, and some features of the Utility system. Through this combination, GOBT can provide a decision-making mechanism that accurately reflects the developer's intent while granting AI agents the ability to flexibly respond to various situations. The intuitive structure of traditional behavior trees combined with dynamic planning generation from GOAP and utility-based decision-making allows agents to make more diverse and appropriate decisions even in dynamically changing environments.

## Approach:

 1. We add a **Planner Node** to the existing behavior tree that can handle dynamic planning. This node is responsible for planning and executing an action sequence from the action set that can achieve a predetermined goal.

<br/>

 2. The agent has state variables. Every action within the action set has a utility function, and when the Planner Node plans, each action yields a utility value through state variables and utility functions.

<br/>
   
 3. The Planner Node selects actions to use in planning based on the calculated utility values of actions.Through this, flexible decision-making based on real-time can be performed within the behavior tree.

## Comparison with existing Behavior Trees

<br/>


### 1. Simplification of Tree
  > Complex branches of the tree can be replaced with a single node by automating and solving complex conditions and behavior processing logic through Planner Nodes.

<br/>

### 2. Providing Flexibility
  > By monitoring goals continuously in real-time using state variable values in Planner Nodes, it generates and executes optimal plans to achieve these goals.

<br/>

### 3. Excellent Scalability
  > Features can be expanded by adding nodes like extending traditional behavior trees. In traditional behavior trees, there may be cases where sub-nodes need to be modified for additional features, but in GOBT, expansions like those from GOAP and Utility systems are easily possible without damaging existing systems by simply adding action nodes or utility functions to Planner Nodes.
