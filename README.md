# GOBT(Goal-Oriented Behavior Tree)
 ### A Synergistic Approach to Game AI Using Goal-Oriented and Utility-Based  Planning in Behavior Trees


  > Development of a game AI architecture framework that combines behavioral trees with GOAP and utility systems to achieve both high intuitiveness and flexibility.


<br/>

 ### Development Background
  >Behavior trees, widely used in game AI architecture, are effective for organizing and controlling the behavior of game characters due to their hierarchical structure. They are also easy to visually represent, making it easier for developers or other team members to understand and predict logic. While behavior trees have high intuitiveness, managing them can become complex when implementing intricate AI in large-scale games due to the potential rapid increase in tree depth and width. Additionally, they operate based on a static structure designed at the time of development, which may not adequately handle situations that developers did not anticipate.

  >This study aims to propose an AI framework named "GOBT (Goal-Oriented Behavior Tree)" to supplement existing behavior trees. This framework is a fusion of traditional behavior trees, Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) which is a goal-oriented behavioral planning framework, and some features of the Utility system. Through this combination, GOBT can provide a decision-making mechanism that accurately reflects the developer's intent while granting AI agents the ability to flexibly respond to various situations. The intuitive structure of traditional behavior trees combined with dynamic planning generation from GOAP and utility-based decision-making allows agents to make more diverse and appropriate decisions even in dynamically changing environments.
